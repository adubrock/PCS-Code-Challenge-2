====================

HQ9+ Code Challenge

*Easy Homework

1.  Created a method "h" that is a global method
    * "h" outputs "Hello World!" and exits the program.

2.  Created an HQ9F class

3.  Created two more methods inside the HQ9F class: "_99" and "+." 

    a. "_99" takes one variable: the number of bottles of beer on the wall. It outputs the lyrics to the hugely popular "99 Bottles Of Beer On The Wall" song, including a sad lament when there is no more beer.

    b. "+" increments the accumulator.
